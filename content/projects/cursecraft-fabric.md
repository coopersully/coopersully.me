### ðŸ“– What is Cursecraft Fabric?
Cursecraft is an all-in-one fabric mod for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to do one thing: expand the survival experience;
it implements new items, blocks, dimensions, game mechanics, and more, all tied together with a connected storyline.
Unlike our previous datapacks such as Vanilla Expansion, the goal of this datapack is to completely overhaul the survival experience.
Cursecraft adds brand new quest-lines, items, blocks, mobs, game mechanics, dimensions, potions, enchantments, and so much more.

### ðŸ”Ž Overview
#### Goals & Achievements
The goal of this gamemode is to provide a story-driven modpack-like experience all in a datapack.
It plays with the ideas of automation & machinery, magic, good and evil, light and dark, and the combination of all of these things for a greater purpose.
The world of Cursecraft is one that is vivid but very gloomy and twisted at first glance; similar to games such as Don't Starve Together or Destiny 2,
the game always feels like a challenge and one where there is always something greater at play.

#### Items & Blocks
There are two main workbenches in Cursecraft:
1. The Advanced Workbench
	- Used to craft technical items, advanced machinery, and more.
2. The Ancient Forge
	- Used to forge magical/supernatural gear, tools, weapons, and items.

These workbenches are used in tandem to create all of the added items and blocks in Cursecraft.

#### Dimensions
There are several dimensions added to the game, the most notable of which are:
- Limbo
	- A barren, purgatorial dimension accessed via the Void.
- Elisium
	- An illuminated, paradisial dimension above the clouds in the Overworld.
- The Nex
	- A hostile, wasteland planet rich in rare minerals but riddled with danger.
	- This dimension can only be accessed via building the Nex portal.

#### How does it differ from the Cursecraft datapack?
Cursecraft Fabric is a modification made with the [Fabric API for Minecraft](https://fabricmc.net/); this allows the mod to
drastically change the game at a level not possible with datapacks. All datapacks for Minecraft: Java Edition are written in
MCFunction only and cannot change the game's actual code.
