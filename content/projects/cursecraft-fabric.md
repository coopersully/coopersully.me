### üìñ What is Cursecraft Fabric?
Cursecraft is an all-in-one fabric mod for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to do one thing: expand the survival experience;
it implements new items, blocks, dimensions, game mechanics, and more, all tied together with a connected storyline.
Unlike our previous datapacks such as Vanilla Expansion, the goal of this datapack is to completely overhaul the survival experience.
Cursecraft adds brand new quest-lines, items, blocks, mobs, game mechanics, dimensions, potions, enchantments, and so much more.


### ‚öñÔ∏è How does it differ from the Cursecraft datapack?
Cursecraft Fabric is a modification made with the [Fabric API for Minecraft](https://fabricmc.net/); this allows the mod to
drastically change the game at a level not possible with datapacks. All datapacks for Minecraft: Java Edition are written in
MCFunction only and cannot change the game's actual code.
