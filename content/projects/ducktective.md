### ðŸ“– What is Ducktective?
Made in Unity with C#, Ducktective is a 3D, third-person RPG game in which a young boy must collect clues and solve puzzles to save his mother from her captor.
The game features a completely custom dialogue system, quest system, player movement, and economy mechanics to bring the experience to life. The player must traverse several
custom environments, talking with townsfolk to uncover clues about his mother's disappearance. As they progress, the world is dynamically updated to fit the player's
current progress: removing and locking older storyline elements while adding new ones into play; the game evolves with the player.

### ðŸ”Ž Overview
#### Storyline
Gami, the story's protaganist, is on a mission to find and save the life of his sister, Aura. She has been kidnapped by a group of deranged cultists infamously known
as "The Wayward." Gami chases the wayward, following them through the town and into the sewers. As he traverses the sewers, he must collect oxygen capsules to replentish
his clean air supply and avoid suffocation.
