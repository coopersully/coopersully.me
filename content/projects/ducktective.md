### ðŸ“– What is Ducktective?
Made in Unity with C#, Ducktective is a 3D, third-person RPG game in which a young boy must collect clues and solve puzzles to save his mother from her captor.
The game features a completely custom dialogue system, quest system, player movement, and economy mechanics to bring the experience to life. The player must traverse several
custom environments, talking with townsfolk to uncover clues about his mother's disappearance. As they progress, the world is dynamically updated to fit the player's
current progress: removing and locking older storyline elements while adding new ones into play; the game evolves with the player.

### ðŸ”Ž Overview
#### Storyline
A young duck living with his mother is doing his daily chores when he returns home to a crime scene. The house is wrecked, his mother has disappeared,
and seemingly the only lead he has is the message carved into the floor: "I'LL KEEP HER SAFE." In his search for his mother, he must complete quests,
gather evidence, solve clues, and interrogate townsfolk.
