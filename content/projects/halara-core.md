### ðŸ“– What is Halara-Core?
Halara-Core is a plugin (additive file) for Minecraft: Java Edition built with the [Spigot API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT).
Originally created for the [Halara Minecraft Network](https://mc.halara.net), Halara-Core serves as a library of custom GUIS, commands,
and more for use all throughout the network.

### ðŸ”Ž Overview
#### Commands
- ``/help`` greets the user with an interactive chat-menu of F.A.Q.'s and useful topics for server-related issues. 
	- Each topic contains a hyperlink to the server's website for a more detailed description of the corresponding issue and possible solutions.
- ``/fakejoin [user]`` sends a pseudo-"join event" packet to the server, displaying a false user join message.
	- This command can only be used by users with the ``group.moderator`` permission node.
- ``/fakeleave [user]`` sends a pseudo-"join event" packet to the server, displaying a false user join message.
	- This command can only be used by users with the ``group.moderator`` permission node.
- ``/go`` opens an interactive server-selection G.U.I. in which users can select a server in the network to connect to.
	- Each possible server is represented with an icon in the menu, clicking the icon connects to the server.
	- When hovered, each icon displays the server name, a brief description, and the current status of the server (pictured below).
