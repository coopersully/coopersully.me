### ðŸ“– What is Curse's RPG Addon?
Curse's RPG Addon is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to change up the survival experience by adding roleplay-themed items, blocks, and mobs to the game. 
It modifies the loot pools of mobs in the game to better immerse the player in an open world, roleplay-ready environment.
There are several changes and additions to the loot found in structures throughout all worlds, as well as a few new variations of mobs to encounter along the way.

### ðŸ”Ž Overview
#### Treasure Items
This datapack adds several new items and item variants that players can find via exploration;
these items are labeled "Treasure Items" and can be identified by their unique names, appearances, and "Statistics" tabs in their descriptions.
With each treasure item, the color of the item's name determines it's rarity (and usu. it's power-level); the rarities in this datapack are an
adaptation of Minecraft's own color-based rarities and are as follows:
1. Common Treasure Item (White, Non-Colored, &f)
	- This item has the highest probability of dropping and is therefore the most common (300 weight).
	- These items never have abilities.
2. Uncommon Treasure Item (Yellow, &e)
	- This item has the second highest probability of dropping (150 weight).
	- These items usually have little to no abilities.
3. Rare Treasure Item (Aqua, &b)
	- This item has a medium probability of dropping (50 weight).
	- Although not common, these items sometimes have unique abilities.
4. Epic Treasure Item (Light Purple, &d)
	- This item has the second lowest probability of dropping (10 weight).
	- These items will regularly have unique abilities.
5. Mythical Treasure Item (Red, &c)
	- This item has the lowest probability of dropping and is therefore the least common (1 weight).
	- These items almost always have unique and strong abilities.

The datapack, similar to vanilla Minecraft, also includes seperate rarity categories that in no way determine the item's power level but are merely for decoration or categorical significance.

- Ominous Treasure Item (Orange, &6, Pillagers Only)

#### Mob & Structure Loot Pools
The loot tables for (almost) all mobs and structures have been overhauled to better fit the roleplay experience. Creatures such as
Zombies, Skeletons, Spiders, Creepers, Villagers, the Ender Dragon, and more have recieved completely new loot tables that include
200+ new items to discover, with 50+ weapons and 25+ new armor sets.

#### Loot Crates
This datapack introduces randomly-spawning loot crates in the overworld; explore the terrain to find stashes
of items, blocks, weapons, and more left behind by travelers long ago. Each crate contains a random assortment
of items corresponding to the crate's theme. A few of the possible crate themes are listed below:
- Building Blocks
- Enchanting Supplies
- Farming Supplies
- Fishing Items
- Huntress Items
- Low-Caliber Military Items
- Mining Items
- Scavenger Items
- Skeleton Remnants
- Spider Debris
- Witch Findings
- Zombie Remains

#### Bosses & Mini-Bosses
There are several new boss-level mobs to encounter, naturally spawning across all dimensions. Many bosses carry
exclusive loot-pools with unique items, enchantments, upgrades, and more. 
- Steel Golem
	- Can be found in the Overworld, most commonly in plains.
	- Throws players upwards and can smash the ground, creating a rippling earthquake effect.
	- Upon death, drops varying quantities of iron ingots, iron blocks, vines, and moss.
- Illusioner
	- Can be found in the Overworld and the End, most commonly in deserts.
	- Can duplicate, create mirages, turn invisible, amd cast spells of varying degrees on the player.
	- When out of range of players, will turn into a mirage of valuable gear and weapons, fully healing. When in range of players, the illusioner will appear and the mirage will dissipate.
	- Upon death, drops *Illusioner's Bow* and drops varying quantities of *Etheral Arrows*, along with the possibility of any magic-related items.
