### What is Curse's RP Addon?
Curse's RP Addon is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to change up the survival experience by adding roleplay-themed items, blocks, and mobs to the game. 
It modifies the loot pools of mobs in the game to better immerse the player in an open world, roleplay-ready environment.
There are several changes and additions to the loot found in structures throughout all worlds, as well as a few new variations of mobs to encounter along the way.
