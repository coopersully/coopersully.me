### ðŸ“– What is Halara-Lobby?
Halara-Lobby is a plugin (additive file) for Minecraft: Java Edition built with the [Spigot API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT).
Originally created for the [Halara Minecraft Network](https://mc.halara.net), Halara-Lobby moderates the "Main Lobby" server and adds various
automations & user-interfaces for a much quicker and easier server-navigation experience. This project depends on [Halara-Core](https://coopersully.me/projects/halara-core/).

### ðŸ”Ž Overview
#### Event Listeners
- User Connections: detects when a player connects to the server specified in the plugin's ``config.yml``.
	- Moves the player's character to the world's origin (X: 0, Y: 0, Z: 0)
	- Changes the player into Adventure Mode, preventing them from interacting with the surrounding environment.
	- Makes the player completely invisible and immobile.
	- Opens the "Server Selection" G.U.I. provided by **Halara-Core**.

#### Commands
- ``/fixspeeds`` resets the player's walking and flying speeds to their default values.
