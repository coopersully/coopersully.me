### ðŸ“– What is Halara-Lobby?
Halara-Lobby is a plugin (additive file) for Minecraft: Java Edition built with the [Spigot API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT).
Originally created for the [Halara Minecraft Network](https://mc.halara.net), Halara-Lobby moderates the "Main Lobby" server and adds various
automations & user-interfaces for a much quicker and easier server-navigation experience. This project depends on [Halara-Core](https://coopersully.me/projects/halara-core/).
