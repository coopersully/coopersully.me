### ðŸ“– What is Baghead?
Made in Unity with C#, Baghead is a 3D, side-scrolling platformer game in which a young boy must save his kidnapped sister by battling monsters and collecting items.
The game features completely custom assets: 3D models, textures, voice overs, sound effects, scripts, and more.

### ðŸ”Ž Overview
#### Storyline
Gami, the story's protaganist, is on a mission to find and save the life of his sister, Aura. She has been kidnapped by a group of deranged cultists infamously known
as "The Wayward." Gami chases the wayward, following them through the town and into the sewers. As he traverses the sewers, he must collect oxygen capsules to replentish
his clean air supply and avoid suffocation.
