### ðŸ“– What is Guardian?
Guardian is a friendly, feature-rich moderation tool for Discord servers with several features:
- An advanced chat filtering system with four levels of intensity.
    1. ``OFF`` disables chat moderation entirely.
    2. ``LOW`` enables light chat moderation, filtering out slurs.
    3. ``MEDIUM`` enables moderate chat moderation, filtering out expletives and slurs.
    4. ``HIGH`` enables intense chat moderation, filtering out all profane language.
- A built-in file manager, allowing users to upload, edit, and access bot-hosted files.
- Connections to popular games such as VALORANT and Fortnite, allowing users to track their stats.
- Connections to social media sites such as Twitter and Instagram, allowing users to search the platforms via easy chat commands.
- An in-depth event and change log like no other, monitoring [almost every event](https://guardian.coopersully.me/docs/logs/) occurring in guilds.

This is just a sprinkle of the features that Guardian can add to a Discord server.
