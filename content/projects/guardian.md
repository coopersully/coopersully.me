### What is Guardian?
Guardian is a friendly, feature-rich moderation tool for the Safehouse discord server with several features:
- An advanced chat filtering system with four levels of intensity.
	1. ``OFF`` disables chat moderation entirely.
	2. ``LOW`` enables light chat moderation, filtering out slurs.
	3. ``MEDIUM`` enables moderate chat moderation, filtering out expletives and slurs.
	4. ``HIGH`` enables intense chat moderation, filtering out all profane language.
- A built-in file manager, allowing users to upload, edit, and access bot-hosted files.
- Ability to detect and announce server events, such as user join/leave events and emoji updates.
- Automatic role assignment for specified users.
