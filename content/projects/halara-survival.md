### What is Halara-Survival?
Halara-Survival is a plugin (additive file) for Minecraft: Java Edition built with the [Spigot API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT).
Originally created for the [Halara Minecraft Network](https://halara.net), Halara-Survival adds several new commands, inventories,
user-interfaces, currency-systems, and items for use in the "Survival" server. This project has a soft-dependency on [Halara-Core](https://coopersully.me/projects/halara-core/)
and depends on & makes use of the [Vault API](https://github.com/milkbowl/Vault).
