### ðŸ“– What is Cursecraft?
Cursecraft is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to do one thing: expand the survival experience.
This datapack creates a modpack-like experience with minimal installation, a connected storyline, and so much more.
Unlike my previous datapacks, the goal of this datapack is to completely overhaul the survival experience.
Cursecraft adds brand new quest-lines, items, blocks, mobs, game mechanics, dimensions, and so much more.
